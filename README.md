# Dragons_Sorcery
Dragons Sorcery is a game project, developed at the Faculty of Computer Engineering, in which the objective is to play a card game, in turns.

* There are 5 monsters against the player, which contain 20 life and 10 mana, and the monsters have different lives and attacks, which in turn can attack the player.

* To play, it's simple, just compile the .c file (Dragon's Sorcery Game), and be happy, use an IDE in C, or Mingw to run in VS Code

Note: If there is a problem, install the <conio.h> library in your compiler.^

The game currently only has an error in the defense cards, so the player will not be able to defend themselves from the monster, I will be fixing this bug soon, that's it, have fun ^^
